## Usage

The purpose of this project was to create an frogger-like arcade game. The player starts at the bottom of the screen and uses the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the player up toward the water. Once the player reaches the water they will win and reset at the original tile.

If the player collides with an Enemy, they will lose and reset at the starting tile.
